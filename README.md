# XCode 

XCode is an integrated development environment (IDE) created by Apple Inc. for developing software apps for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, WatchOS, tvOS and beyond.

In testing, XCode as a simulator is used to install and run the app on virtual iOS devices in order to evaluate the functionality and performance of the app on different versions of iOS and screen sizes. Xcode also includes powerful debugging tools to help identify and fix issues.
